## Postdoctoral Teaching and Research Fellow: Living Data Project for ecology, evolution and environmental science

### Review of applications will begin July 31, 2020

The Faculty of Science seeks a full-time postdoctoral teaching and research fellow to join the NSERC CREATE Living Data Project at the University of Regina. The Living Data Project is a national initiative, led by the [Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution](http://www.ciee-icee.ca/) (CIEE), to

1. preserve &mdash; using best practices in digital archiving and data management &mdash; legacy datasets in ecology, evolution and environmental science;

2. synthesize scientific data and concepts using collaborative team approaches; and

3. provide training for graduate students and other early career researchers in data management, reproducible research, synthesis statistics, and scientific collaboration.

The postdoctoral fellow will be responsible for training and mentorship of graduate students involved in Living Data Project courses, including students from U of R and other CIEE member universities. The postdoctoral researcher will also assist in the organization of data rescue internships with academic and non-academic researchers, and organize, in collaboration with similar postdoctoral fellows located at other Canadian universities, multi-institutional training events such as workshops and working groups. The postdoctoral fellow will be provided with opportunities to be involved in research through the working groups and other collaborations with Living Data Project members, and will expand their professional networks and exposure to nonacademic employers. U of R faculty will assist the postdoctoral fellow in designing and implementing their own customized professional development plan.

We seek a highly qualified individual with a PhD in any area of ecology, evolution, or environmental science who has demonstrated exceptional skills in data management, statistical analysis, and scientific collaboration. Priority will be given to candidates who have proficiency in at least some of the following skills: data archiving, R programming, version control (e.g. GitHub), reproducible research, database construction, collation of large databases from multiple sources, citizen science, statistics (e.g. hierarchical modelling, structural equation models, meta-analysis), and collaborating in working groups. We particularly encourage candidates with prior experience in teaching or mentoring of the above skills. Candidates should also have: excellent organizational, interpersonal, and communication skills; fluency in spoken and written English; and a strong personal commitment to research and teaching. French language skills are also an asset.

Applicants should submit

* a CV,
* statement of relevant experience and training,
* short statements on EDI and Open Science (300 words each), and
* the names and contact information (including phone and e-mail) of up to three references

to: Dr. Kerri Finlay (kerri.finlay@uregina.ca), and/or Dr. Gavin Simpson (gavin.simpson@uregina.ca). Review of applications will begin July 31, 2020 and the position will remain open until filled, with the appointment anticipated to begin no later than September 1, 2020. The appointment is initially for one year, and following a successful performance review the candidate may be reappointed for a second year ending August 31, 2022. The successful applicant will receive a salary of $50,000 per year plus benefits.

The University of Regina hires on the basis of merit and is committed to employment equity. The position is subject to final budgetary approval. The University of Regina is committed to an inclusive workplace that reflects the richness of the communities that we serve. The University welcomes applications from all qualified individuals, including individuals within the Universityâ€™s employment equity categories of women, persons with disabilities, members of visible minorities, Indigenous persons, individuals of diverse gender and sexual orientation and all groups protected by the Human Rights Code.

<!-- Currently there are no open positions in the lab, but I'm always interested in talking with potential graduate students or postdoctoral fellows about opportunities for funding and research ideas, so do please [get in touch](mailto:gavin.simpson@uregina.ca). -->
