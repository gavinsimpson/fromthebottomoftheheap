Learning from data involves trade offs

We can have models that fit our data well &mdash; low bias &mdash; but which are highly variable, or

We can fit models that have lower variance, but these tend to have higher bias, i.e. fit the data less well

A linear regression model is very interpretable but unless the underlying relationship is linear it will have poor fit

Deep learning may fit data incredibly well but the model is very difficult to interpret and understand

Splines are built up from basis functions

Here I'm showing a cubic regression spline basis with 10 knots/functions

We weight each basis function to get a spline. Here all the basisi functions have the same weight so they would fit a horizontal line

# Weight basis functions &#8680; spline

```{r basis-function-animation, results = 'hide'}
bfun_plt <- plot(bfuns) +

    labs(x = 'x', y = 'f(x)') +

anim_save('resources/basis-fun-anim.gif', bfun_anim)

But if we choose different weights we get more wiggly spline

Each of the splines I showed you earlier are all generated from the same basis functions but using different weights

# Mean

???

The mean

When we analyze data we mostly focus on this property of our data

With summary statistics we often talk about the average of a set of values

Or in a statistical model we might estimate expected change in the response for some change in one or more covariates

Or we may be interested in estimating the trend in a data series where the trend described how the expected value of y changes over time

# Variance

There are other important properties of data however and in the short case study I want to talk about the variance & how we can use statistical models to investigate changes in the variance of ecosystems over time

The variance is an important measure of ecosystem state

Ecologists have linked variance with coexistence of populations and variance can be interpreted in terms of resilience theory

Here I'm showing two cartoons;

A: in the high resilience state the ecosystem returns rapidly to the equilibrium following perturbation and hence has low variance

B: in the low resilience state, where the basin of attraction has become shallower, the ecosystem takes longer to return to equilibrium following perturbation and hence exhibits high variance

Variance, however, is much harder to estimate from data

???

One way to estimate the variance of a series is by using a moving window

Here the analyst first detrends the time series

Choose an appropriate window size

Starting from the beginning of the series calculate the variance of the observations in the window

Move the window along one time step and repeat 3 and 4 until you get to the end of the series

A trend in the resulting variance time series is estimated using Kendall's rank correlation tau

In this example the interest was in the end of the series so they right-aligned the window meaning they had to observe half the series before they could calculate the variance

---

# Problems

*Ad hoc*

* How to detrend (method, complexity of trend, ...)
* What window width?

Ideally regularly spaced data

* What to do about gaps, missing data, irregularly spaced data?

Statistical testing hard

* Kendall's $\tau$ assumes independence
* Surrogate time series assumes regular sampling, sensitive to choice of ARMA

???

The whole approach is *ad hoc* with many knobs to twiddle &mdash; how do you detrend the series? what width of window should be used?

Suited to regularly spaced data so you have the same number of observations in each window, but what about series with data gaps, missing observations, or data that are irregularly spaced?

Statistical inference is very hard; Kendall's tau assumes the data are independence but they can't be because of the moving window. Sometime surrogate time series are used to assess significance of the trend in variance; Surrogate time series are series generated with known properties that don't have a change in variance, but these approaches rely on classical techniques like ARMA models which only work for regularly spaced data and the test is sensitive to choice of orders in the ARMA

Cottingham *et al* (2000) **Ecology Letters** showed via a Levene's test that **variances** pre- & post-intervention were different

???

The lake was experimentally manipulated to investigate responses to increased nutrients

The lake is annually laminated and Peter Leavitt, URegina, measured the sub-fossil pigment concentrations for each year between 1943 and 1990

Kathy Cottingham, Jim Rusak, and Peter Leavitt previously analyzed these data by separating them into control and treated sections and compared the variances of the two periods with a Levene's test, equivalent of a t-test but for differences of variances not means

They showed that the algal community was more variable in the treated period than in the pre-manipulation period

To do this we'll need models for the variance of a data set

If we think of the Gaussian distribution that distribution has two parameters, the mean and the variance

In linear regression we model the mean of the response at different values of the covariates, and assume the variance is constant at a value estimated from the residuals

In the left panel I'm showing how the Gaussian distribution changes as we alter the mean while keeping the variance fixed, while in the right panel I keep the mean fixed but vary the variance &mdash; the parameters are independent

# Distributional models

.medium[
$$y_{i} | \boldsymbol{x}_i \sim \mathcal{D}(\vartheta_{1}(\boldsymbol{x}_i), \ldots, \vartheta_{K}(\boldsymbol{x}_i))$$
]

For the Gaussian distribution

* $\vartheta_{1}(\boldsymbol{x}_i) = \mu(\boldsymbol{x}_i)$

* $\vartheta_{2}(\boldsymbol{x}_i) = \sigma(\boldsymbol{x}_i)$

???

Instead of treating the variance as a nuisance parameter, we could model both the variance **and** the mean as functions of the covariates

This is done using what is called a *distributional model*

In this model we say that the response values y_i, given the values of one or more covariates x_i follow some distribution with parameters theta, which are themselves functions of one or more covariates

For the Gaussian distribution theta 1 would be the mean and theta 2 the variance (or standard deviation)

We do not need to restrict ourselves to the Gaussian distribution however

# The Gamma distribution

```{r gamma-dist}
shape <- c(2,2,3,3,5,5)
scale <- c(2,4,2,1,1,0.5)
x <- seq(0, 20, length.out = 500)
df <- as_tibble(as.data.frame(mapply(dgamma, shape, scale, MoreArgs = list(x = x))))
names(df) <- paste('shape =', shape, ', scale =', scale)
df <- add_column(df, x = x, row = seq_len(nrow(df)))
df <- gather(df, 'distribution', 'density', -row, -x)
plt <- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = density, colour = distribution)) +
    geom_line(lwd = 1) + guides(colour = "none") +
    scale_color_discrete(name = "") + ylim(0, 1.5) +
    labs(y = "Probability Density")
plt
```

???

The gamma distribution would be more appropriate for describing the pigment data as it allows for positive continuous values, where those values are skewed, with some large values

Here I'm showing different types of gamma distribution that vary in the mean and their variance and we should note that unlike the Gaussian distribution, we cannot change the mean without also changing the variance of the gamma distribution

# Lake 227 sedimentary pigments

Fitted gamma distributional model using **brms** and **Stan**
\begin{align*}
y_t    & \sim \mathcal{G}(\mu = \eta_{1,t}, \alpha = \eta_{2,t}) \\
\eta_{1,t} & = \exp(f_{1,\text{pigment}}(\text{Year}_t)) \\
\eta_{2,t} & = \exp(f_{2,\text{pigment}}(\text{Year}_t))
\end{align*}

???

To estimate how the mean and the variance of the pigment data changed during the experimental manipulation, I fitted a gamma distributional model using the brms package and the Stan Bayesian software

We assume the responses are conditionally distributed gamma, and we model the mean and the shape parameter of the distribution with linear predictors

Each linear predictor includes a smooth function of Year for each pigment

After fitting we calculate the variance at each time point using the estimated values of the mean and the shape parameters using the posterior distribution of the response to generate credible intervals

This plot shows the estimated mean concentration for the five pigments estimated from the model, and which shows the increase in algal abundance during the experimental manipulation

    labs(x = NULL, y = expression(Estimated ~ sigma ~ (italic(n) * g ~ g^{-1})))
```

???

In this plot are showing the estimated variance throughout the time series

We clearly see the increased variance in the algal communities that Cottingham et al observed, but now we can provide a continuous estimate of the variance over time rather than having to split the data into two and compare the variance of the two time periods

---

# Summary

* Using distributional GAMs we now have a means to robustly estimate the variance of an system and how that variance changes over time

* Use models such as these to begin to quantify an important ecological metric from a principled statsitical view point

# Central Limit Theorem

???

Central limit theorem shows us that the Gaussian or normal distribution is the sampling distribution for many sample statistics, including sample means, as samples sizes become large

Central limit theorem underlies much of the theory that justifies much of the statistics you learn about in your statistics courses, and supports the use of the Gaussian or normal distribution

# Summary

* Lake **minimum** surface water temperatures have increased by on the order of 1&ndash;3 degrees over the last 60 years

* Evidence that the distribution of annual minima has changed in many lakes &mdash; implications for future extreme events which have long-term knock-on effects

* Distributional GAMs with the GEV distribution are an excellent way of modelling common trends in environmental extremes
